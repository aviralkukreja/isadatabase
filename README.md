The Cal Poly Information Systems Association (ISA) is Cal Polyâ€™s premier on-campus club for any students interested in 
information systems. The following project is a fully functioning database to help organize all the data that is necessary 
by the ISA officer team. This project utilizes the power of SQL to help input and organize data.

1) The first portion of the master file consists of create statements that build the initial structure of the database.
2) Next, the insert statements are all the data that needs to be added into the database. ISA has kept information about their 
members, alumni, and other relevant data, but never had an organized place for this information. Now, the club has a central
database for all the information they record.
3) Following are the sample queries to show the various actions that can be executed in relation to the database.
4) We ended the master file with deletion scripts in case the officers find certain information unnecessary. 

The ERD screenshot provides a visual depiction of the database and the relationships between each table.

The ODB file is the official database.
